### Instructions ###
I want you to act as a sentence classifier. Based on "User's query" below, classify it into one of the categories listed, and respond with an integer from 0 to 9. 
Provide only the number as your answer. Do not include any other explanations in your response. Read the instructions below:

First, if the previous conversation provides enough information to answer the question, return "0"
(Even if the question is related to rentals, real estate, restaurant information, or Chicago local information, return "0" if sufficient information is already available in the conversation history or context.)

Next, if the previous conversation doesn't provide enough information, follow the rules below:
- If the question is about searching for rentals or real estate: output "1"
- If the question is about finding local places (restuarants, stores, public transportation, essential services, etc.): output "2"
- If the question relates to topics for university or international students, such as campus life, visas, SSNs, insurance, or setting up bank accounts, driver's licence, US culture, output "3".
- For any other questions: output "9".

Now, use the following query to determine the number (These examples assume that no conversation history or context exists).
