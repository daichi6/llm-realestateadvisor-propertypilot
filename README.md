## 1. Motivation üåé

### Background

As the number of international students in the United States continues to rise, the need for effective support systems becomes increasingly vital. In the 2022/23 academic year, there were over 1 million international students in the U.S., reflecting significant growth from previous years.

Embarking on an academic journey abroad is both exciting and challenging for international students. Navigating a new country, culture, and legal system can be overwhelming. While numerous platforms offer property listings or cultural tips, there's a lack of comprehensive solutions that address all the needs of international students in one place.

### Common Challenges Faced by International Students

- **Legal and Visa Requirements**: Questions like "What are the steps to apply for an F-1 student visa?" or "How do I maintain my visa status while studying?"
- **Housing**: Finding safe, affordable housing, understanding lease agreements, and determining the documents needed for renting.
- **Cultural Differences**: Navigating cultural norms, understanding social etiquette, and overcoming language barriers.
- **Logistical Issues**: Setting up bank accounts, getting health insurance, finding transportation options, and more.

InternationAlly bridges these gaps by providing tailored housing options, local insights, and essential support throughout a student's move.

### Goals & Value Proposition

**InternationAlly** aims to:

- Provide an **efficient and comprehensive** way for international students to secure housing.
- Offer **guidance** on legal, cultural, and logistical matters to help students adapt smoothly.
- Act as a **trusted friend and advisor**, simplifying the complexities of moving abroad.

## 4. Evaluation & Testing üìä

### Evaluation Framework and Results

To ensure **InternationAlly** provides accurate, relevant, and helpful responses, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation and testing process that included both automated assessments using Large Language Models (LLMs) and user testing with international students.

**Evaluation Objectives**
We focused on evaluating the following key features:
- **Property Search:** Ability to provide property listings that accurately match user criteria.
- **Local Advisor:** Offering relevant recommendations for local amenities and services.
- **International Student Advisor:** Providing accurate guidance on legal, cultural, and logistical matters.
- **General Queries:** Handling miscellaneous questions while maintaining appropriate tone and professionalism.

**Evaluation Metrics**
We defined the following metrics to assess the quality of responses:
1. **Relevance:** How directly the response addresses the user's specific question or request.
2. **Accuracy:** The correctness and up-to-dateness of the information provided.
3. **Clarity:** The ease with which the user can understand the response.
4. **Completeness:** Whether the response fully addresses all parts of the user's question.
5. **Tone and Empathy:** The appropriateness of the response's tone and the level of empathy shown towards the user.
Each response was scored on a scale from 0 to 100 for each metric.

**Automated Evaluation Using GPT 4o**
We customized a "GPT" on ChatGPT to act as an evaluator to assess the responses generated by InternationAlly:

This bar chart illustrates the performance of each feature across the evaluation metrics. Overall, InternationAlly performs consistently well across most metrics, with scores typically ranging between 70 and 100. With high performance across features, Clarity and Tone & Empathy are InternationAlly's forte. However, our evaluation also helped to highlight the areas where InternationAlly still has room for improvement.

### User Testing

We conducted user testing to gather real-world feedback on usability and relevance.

**Users**:

We recruited international students friends from diverse backgrounds and programs at the University of Chicago.
Participants were informed about the purpose and consented to provide feedback.

**Testing Process:**

**Simulated Scenarios:** Participants were asked to imagine planning their move to the U.S. and interact with InternationAlly to accomplish tasks such as:
- Finding suitable housing within their budget.
- Asking logistical questions about moving to the U.S. (e.g., setting up bank accounts, phone plans).
- Exploring local amenities like restaurants and grocery stores.
- Open Exploration: Allowed users to explore the app freely and ask any questions they might have.

**Data Collection:**
- Observations: Noted user interactions, difficulties, and any confusion.
- Think-Aloud Protocol: Encouraged participants to verbalize their thoughts while using the app.
- [Survey](https://forms.gle/nit8BcmzLkr1wan98): Collected quantitative and qualitative feedback through a post-testing survey.
- Interviews: Conducted brief interviews to delve deeper into users' experiences.

**User Feedback**
- Users appreciated the personalized assistance and found the app helpful for planning their move.
- Helped to idenify areas where responses lacked accuracy or completeness, especially in legal and logistical guidance. This helped us to refine prompts and prioritize new data sources to add.
- Received great suggestions for ways to improve the navigation and visual appeal of the app to enhance the user experience

This comprehensive evaluation and testing process allowed us to refine InternationAlly, ensuring it meets the needs of international students by providing accurate, relevant, and empathetic support throughout their transition.

## 5. Differentiators ‚ú®

Over the past several months, the capabilities of foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved rapidly. Features like real-time web search and advanced data processing, which were not available when we began developing InternationAlly, are now more common. However, despite these advancements, InternationAlly continues to stand out due to several key differentiators:

1. **Personalized and Specific Recommendations:** InternationAlly provides highly tailored advice and recommendations that are specifically tied to each user's individual situation. Unlike general-purpose LLMs such as Google Gemini which often require the user to remind the model of their details and situation, our platform considers the unique needs, preferences, and circumstances of international students. This ensures that every piece of advice is relevant, actionable, and directly applicable to the user's journey.

2. **Warm Tone and Empathetic Support:** While foundational LLMs can adopt a friendly tone if prompted, this requires extra effort from the user and may feel inauthentic. InternationAlly maintains a warm, friendly, and helpful demeanor by default. Our assistant is designed to offer empathetic support, making users feel understood and cared for without the need for additional prompting. This consistent, caring personality provides a more personalized and comforting experience.

3. **School-Specific Data and Answers:** InternationAlly can be tailored to the needs of individual universities, ingesting school-specific data and providing targeted answers. For example:

  - Housing recommendations that reflect the unique housing market near a particular campus.
  - Insights into local amenities and transportation tailored to the school‚Äôs surrounding neighborhoods.
  - Answers to logistical questions that reflect the specific policies and resources of a given university.

 By ingesting school-specific web pages and resources, we provide accurate, up-to-date, and detailed information relevant to a student's particular institution. This level of specificity is not typically available in general-purpose LLMs, making InternationAlly an invaluable resource for navigating school-related matters.

4. **Specialized Focus:** InternationAlly is purpose-built for international students, addressing their specific challenges and needs.  Unlike generic real estate platforms or LLMs that provide broad information, InternationAlly offers specialized support in housing, legal guidance, cultural adaptation, and logistical assistance‚Äîall in one place.

In summary, while foundational LLMs have become more capable, InternationAlly offers a level of personalization, empathy, and specialized knowledge that sets it apart. Our focus on the unique journey of international students makes us an indispensable ally in navigating the complexities of moving abroad.
