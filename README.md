## 1. Motivation üåé

### Background

Our project, InternationAlly, was inspired by the personal experiences of our team‚Äîthree international students who faced common challenges while studying abroad. From finding affordable housing and navigating unfamiliar cities to understanding visa requirements, we struggled to find reliable resources to answer our questions. This inspired us to develop a chatbot solution that could help international students with these issues.

Research shows that international student enrollment in the U.S. is rapidly growing, with over 1.5 million students, contributing significantly to the economy. This expanding student population highlights a clear demand for solutions like InternationAlly. By providing accessible, smart support, InternationAlly aims to help international students navigate both academic and everyday challenges.

- **Housing**: Finding safe, affordable housing, understanding lease agreements, and determining the documents needed for renting.
- **Cultural Differences**: Navigating cultural norms, understanding social etiquette, and overcoming language barriers.
- **Logistical Issues**: Setting up bank accounts, getting health insurance, finding transportation options, and more.

## 4. Evaluation & Testing üìä

### Evaluation Framework and Results

To ensure **InternationAlly** provides accurate, relevant, and helpful responses, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation and testing process that included both automated assessments using Large Language Models (LLMs) and user testing with international students.

**Evaluation Objectives**
We focused on evaluating the following key features:
- **Property Search:** Ability to provide property listings that accurately match user criteria.
- **Local Advisor:** Offering relevant recommendations for local amenities and services.
- **International Student Advisor:** Providing accurate guidance on legal, cultural, and logistical matters.
- **General Queries:** Handling miscellaneous questions while maintaining appropriate tone and professionalism.

**Evaluation Metrics**
We defined the following metrics to assess the quality of responses:
1. **Relevance:** How directly the response addresses the user's specific question or request.
2. **Accuracy:** The correctness and up-to-dateness of the information provided.
3. **Clarity:** The ease with which the user can understand the response.
4. **Completeness:** Whether the response fully addresses all parts of the user's question.
5. **Tone and Empathy:** The appropriateness of the response's tone and the level of empathy shown towards the user.
Each response was scored on a scale from 0 to 100 for each metric.

**Automated Evaluation Using GPT 4o**
We customized a "GPT" on ChatGPT to act as an evaluator to assess the responses generated by InternationAlly:
[**InternationAlly GPT Evaluator**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-674265ee4f108191af0363b4b5c228e3-internationally-evaluator)

**Evaluation Process:**

The evaluator was provided with [this structured prompt](evaluation/llm_evaluator_prompt.txt) to evaluate each response based on the defined metrics, generating scores along with brief justifications for each.

1. Preparation of Test Queries: Compiled [this set of representative user queries](evaluation/eval_user_queries.txt) covering all key features.
2. Response Generation: InternationAlly generated responses to each query.
3. LLM Evaluation: The LLM evaluators assessed each response using the [evaluation metrics](evaluation/eval_metrics.txt).
4. Analysis: Analyzed scores and feedback to identify areas for improvement

**Evaluation Results**

![Evaluation Results](images/Evaluation_Score_chart.png)

This bar chart illustrates the performance of each feature across the evaluation metrics. Overall, InternationAlly performs consistently well across most metrics, with scores typically ranging between 70 and 100. With high performance across features, Clarity and Tone & Empathy are InternationAlly's forte. However, our evaluation also helped to highlight the areas where InternationAlly still has room for improvement.

### User Testing

We conducted user testing to gather real-world feedback on usability and relevance.

**Users**:

We recruited international students friends from diverse backgrounds and programs at the University of Chicago.
Participants were informed about the purpose and consented to provide feedback.

**Testing Process:**

**Simulated Scenarios:** Participants were asked to imagine planning their move to the U.S. and interact with InternationAlly to accomplish tasks such as:
- Finding suitable housing within their budget.
- Asking logistical questions about moving to the U.S. (e.g., setting up bank accounts, phone plans).
- Exploring local amenities like restaurants and grocery stores.
- Open Exploration: Allowed users to explore the app freely and ask any questions they might have.

**Data Collection:**
- Observations: Noted user interactions, difficulties, and any confusion.
- Think-Aloud Protocol: Encouraged participants to verbalize their thoughts while using the app.
- [Survey](https://forms.gle/nit8BcmzLkr1wan98): Collected quantitative and qualitative feedback through a post-testing survey.
- Interviews: Conducted brief interviews to delve deeper into users' experiences.

**User Feedback**
- Users appreciated the personalized assistance and found the app helpful for planning their move.
- Helped to idenify areas where responses lacked accuracy or completeness, especially in legal and logistical guidance. This helped us to refine prompts and prioritize new data sources to add.
- Received great suggestions for ways to improve the navigation and visual appeal of the app to enhance the user experience

This comprehensive evaluation and testing process allowed us to refine InternationAlly, ensuring it meets the needs of international students by providing accurate, relevant, and empathetic support throughout their transition.


## 5. Differentiators ‚ú®

Over the past several months, the capabilities of foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved rapidly. Features like real-time web search and advanced data processing, which were not available when we began developing InternationAlly, are now more common. However, despite these advancements, InternationAlly continues to stand out due to several key differentiators:

1. **Personalized and Specific Recommendations:** InternationAlly provides highly tailored advice and recommendations that are specifically tied to each user's individual situation. Unlike general-purpose LLMs such as Google Gemini which often require the user to remind the model of their details and situation, our platform considers the unique needs, preferences, and circumstances of international students. This ensures that every piece of advice is relevant, actionable, and directly applicable to the user's journey.

2. **Warm Tone and Empathetic Support:** While foundational LLMs can adopt a friendly tone if prompted, this requires extra effort from the user and may feel inauthentic. InternationAlly maintains a warm, friendly, and helpful demeanor by default. Our assistant is designed to offer empathetic support, making users feel understood and cared for without the need for additional prompting. This consistent, caring personality provides a more personalized and comforting experience.

3. **School-Specific Data and Answers:** InternationAlly can be tailored to the needs of individual universities, ingesting school-specific data and providing targeted answers. For example:

  - Housing recommendations that reflect the unique housing market near a particular campus.
  - Insights into local amenities and transportation tailored to the school‚Äôs surrounding neighborhoods.
  - Answers to logistical questions that reflect the specific policies and resources of a given university.

 By ingesting school-specific web pages and resources, we provide accurate, up-to-date, and detailed information relevant to a student's particular institution. This level of specificity is not typically available in general-purpose LLMs, making InternationAlly an invaluable resource for navigating school-related matters.

4. **Specialized Focus:** InternationAlly is purpose-built for international students, addressing their specific challenges and needs.  Unlike generic real estate platforms or LLMs that provide broad information, InternationAlly offers specialized support in housing, legal guidance, cultural adaptation, and logistical assistance‚Äîall in one place.

In summary, while foundational LLMs have become more capable, InternationAlly offers a level of personalization, empathy, and specialized knowledge that sets it apart. Our focus on the unique journey of international students makes us an indispensable ally in navigating the complexities of moving abroad.
